    <p>Thank you for completing the activities as a test-taker!</p>

    <p>In some of the previous rounds, you were matched with the following helpers: </p>
    <ul>
      {{ for partner in input }}
      <li><p>{{ partner }}</p></li>
      {{ endfor }}
    </ul>

    <p>We are about to communicate to each helper the number of hints that you asked for in each subject round in which you were paired together.</p>
    <p>Would you like to stop us from giving this information to one of the helpers?</p>
    <p>We give you the chance to pay some amount of money NOT to communicate to one of the helpers whether you took some hints.</p>
