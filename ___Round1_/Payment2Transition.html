          <li>In this round, you will make decisions as a helper and be matched with different test-takers.</li>

            <li><b>We will implement your decisions in the following parts should a certain
              match be realized during the experiment.</b></li>
            <li>Decisions made here will affect the number of hints available
            to the test-takers in later parts.</li>
            <li>For instance, if test-taker X is matched with you, the hints s/he
              receives will be determined by the choices you are about to make in
              this round (in some of his/her parts)</li>
            <li><b>You will see the number of hints the test-taker took for each subject.</b></li>
