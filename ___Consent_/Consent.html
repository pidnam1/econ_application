    <b><p>Study Title: Information Flow in Teams</p>

    <p>Protocol #: 5183</p>

    <p>Please read this consent agreement carefully before you decide to participate in the study.</p></b>

    <p></p>

    <p><b>Purpose of the research study:</b> The purpose of the study is to understand how people
    use information in teams and individually, especially in situations where they
    are not completely sure about knowing the right answer for the task they are performing.</p>

    <p><b>Time required:</b> The study will require about 3-3.5 hours of your time. The survey
    administered initially should take approximately 6-7 minutes, the survey administered
    at the end should take 20 minutes, and the activities in between will take around
    2.5-3 hours. The planned total length of the study includes the time for reading
    the explanation and for organizational purposes. Even if you finish before others
    in the room, you may have to wait for others to finish. Thus, do not rush through
    the activity.</p>

    <p><b>Risks:</b> There are no anticipated risks in this study.</p>

    <p><b>Benefits:</b> There are no direct benefits to you from participating in the study.
    This study will help us to understand one of the channels through which individual
    can improve their performances which is to seek help from another person.</p>

    <p><b>Confidentiality:</b> Any information you would provide would be treated with the
    utmost degree of confidentiality. Once you consent to participate in this study,
    on the day of the study you shall be provided with a private unique id. Any response
    sheet that you fill (survey sheet or test sheet) would require you to fill this id,
    and not any identifying information other than phone number. Identifying information
    like name and roll number, obtained from administrative data shall not be kept
    together with the rest of the responses you provide. The list connecting your
    identifying information to the unique id will be kept in a locked file, separate
    from the primary data set to be used for analysis. The survey and the test sheets
    will be destroyed once the data has been digitally uploaded. Your name will not
    be used in any report. The phone numbers that we collect to facilitate payments
    shall also be destroyed after payments have been made.</p>

    <p><b>Voluntary participation:</b> Your participation in the study is completely voluntary.
    You may stop the survey at any time. You are under no obligation to answer any
    or all questions. You can easily skip any number of questions you wish to, depending
    on your convenience and your willingness to respond. We wish to make it clear
    that your decision to participate or continue to participate in this study will
    have no effect on grades or school services.</p>

    <p><b>Right to withdraw from the study:</b> You have the right to withdraw from the study
    at any time without penalty and it will not affect your grades or school services.
    If you withdraw in the middle of the experiment, payment will be based on the
    number of sessions in which you have participated already. If you withdraw from
    the study, all the data collected from you or about you will be purged.</p>

    <p><b>How to withdraw from the study:</b> If you want to leave the study at any time please
    raise your hand and one of us will come and talk to you. You can then communicate
    with us and leave the room. If you would like to withdraw after the study has
    finished please contact us at sa8ey@virginia.edu.</p>

    <p><b>Payment:</b> If you agree to participate in this study, we shall provide
    you with 300 PKR as participation fees. In the last survey, we will play a game
    in which you will have a chance to win up to 250 Rs. (determined by a random draw).</p>

    <p>In addition to the participation fees, in each role (test-taker and helper),
    you will be eligible to additional payments according to rules specified in each
    round. Your payments as helper and test-taker will be summed up at the end of the
    study. The minimum cash prize that players can receive, if no questions are answered
    correctly by them as a test-taker or as a helper with the associated test-taker is
    the 300 PKR show-up fee. The maximum for any one player, given perfect scores and
    luck of the draw of rounds and partners, is 2500 PKR. </p>

    <p>To additionally incentivize participation, a lucky draw would be conducted to
    provide students with other prizes like mobile power banks and USBs. We plan to
    give away 1 power bank per class. A power bank is a portable mobile charging
    station. On average, the expected class size is 35 people. Therefore, the odds
    for winning a power bank are around 1 to 35. We also plan to give away 3 USBs
    per class. The odds for winning a USB are around 3 to 35. All payments shall
    be made through mobile credits via ‘easy load’.</p>

    <p><b>Using data beyond this study:</b> Any information that you provide shall not be used
    beyond the purposes of research and publication. However, the data that we collect
    could be used to explore other hypotheses in the future. But at no point of time,
    your confidentiality will be violated. The researcher would like to make the information
    collected in this study available to other researchers after the study is completed.
    This is a requirement for the purposes of replication and verification of the
    results we find during this study. The researcher will remove any identifying
    information (such as your name, contact information, etc.) connected to the information
    you provide. The researcher will share all the information collected in this study
    (not just your individual file) with other researchers for future research studies.
    The details of the future research topics are not known at this point in time.
    The researcher will make the anonymized information available on public academic
    platforms. Researchers of future studies will not ask your permission for each
    new study. The other researcher will not have access to your name and or to any
    other information that could potentially identify you nor will they attempt to
    identify you.</p>
