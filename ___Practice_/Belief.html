         <p>In the previous questions, we were asking you the following follow-up question:</p>
         <p>'Fill in the blank: I think my answer has a __% chance of being right. A randomly drawn computer should answer for me if its accuracy is greater than that.'</p>
         <p>Now we will practice how to answer this question correctly.</p>

        <p>EXAMPLE</p>
        <i><p>If you write down that your answer has a 58% chance of being right
        for this question, and the randomly-drawn computer is accurate 89% of the
        time, what will happen?</p>
        <p> &nbsp; &nbsp; a. Your answer will be submitted, since the computer drawn has an accuracy higher than your threshold</p>
        <p> &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>b. The computer's answer will be submitted, since the computer drawn has an accuracy higher that your threshold</b></p>
        <p> &nbsp; &nbsp; c. I am not sure</p></i>

        <b><p>The answer to the above question is (b) because the computer has higher "confidence" in its answer being correct than you do.</p></b>
