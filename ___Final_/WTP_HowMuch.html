    <p>Now you have to decide how much to pay to avoid that each helper finds out about your hints.</p>
    <p>You can pay any amount between 1 and 75 Rs for each of the helpers you selected</p>

    <p>Once you decide how much to pay, we will randomly draw a number between 0 and 75 for each of the given helpers. </p>
    <ul>
      <li>If the number drawn is equal or higher than the price you decided to pay,
      we will still communicate your hints to the helper you selected and you won’t need to pay anything.</li>
      <li>If the number drawn is lower than the price you decided to pay,
      we won’t communicate your hints to the helper you selected and the price will be deducted from your final payment. </li>
    </ul>

    <p>Let’s make an example. Let’s say you want to pay 5. If the number randomly drawn
    by the computer is higher than or equal to 5, we will communicate your hints to the
    helper and you won’t need to pay anything. If the number randomly drawn by the computer
    is lower than 5, we won’t communicate your hints to the helper and 5 will be deducted from your final payment. </p>

    <p>Now it’s your turn to decide:</p>
    <table class="table">
        <tr>
            <th>Helper Chosen</th>
            <th>I would like to pay ____ Rs. NOT to communicate the hints I took to helper</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
        {{ for l in labels }}
        <tr>
          <td>{{ l.label }}</td>
          <td>{{ formfield l.name }}<td>
        </tr>
        {{ endfor }}
    </table>

    <p>
        <button class="otree-btn-next btn btn-primary" style="float:right">Next - draw random number</button>
    </p>
