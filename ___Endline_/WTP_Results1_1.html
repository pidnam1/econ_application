{{ block content }}

    <p>The number randomly drawn by the computer is: {{ player.participant.random1 }}</p>

    <p>Because {{ player.participant.random1 }} is lower than the {{ player.wtp_howmuch1 }} you are willing to pay,
    you will pay this price and helper {{ partner1 }} will not find out about the hints you took. </p>
